              Perhaps there are only a few people in the world who have not heard about the Taj Mahal, the famous symbol of love. It is an ivory-white mausoleum built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal after her demise. The Taj Mahal today is the resting place of both Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan. The tombs are the centerpiece of the 17-hectare complex. The Taj Mahal was probably completely built by 1653. The Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site is today admired by the millions of visitors who visit the site. It is not only one of the 7 wonders of India but also the world.

      The Konark Sun Temple is another one of the 7 wonders of India and is located in Konark, Orissa. The temple was built in 1255 CE by the East Ganga Dynasty ruler, King Narasimhadeva I. The temple is famous for its fascinating architecture and erotic sculptures. The main attraction is the sun-chariot-styled temple with elaborately carved wheels, walls, and pillars. Though a major part is in ruins, what remains is enough to draw the attention of visitors to the Konark Sun Temple. The temple is dedicated to the Sun God. Its architecture and engineering continue to baffle modern architects and engineers.

    The Gomateshwara is a giant statue of Bahubali, a revered figure of the Jain community of India. Bahubali was Rishabhanatha's (the first Jain tirthankara) son. Bahubali is said to have attained moksha or salvation by meditating while standing motionless for a year till climbing plants grew around his legs. The giant Gommateshwara statue was thus built in ancient India to show respect to Bahubali. It is a 57-foot monolith that is located on a hilltop in Shravanabelagola in the Indian state of Karnataka. The statue was built by Chavundaraya, a minister and commander of the Ganga Dynasty at about AD 981.

    A large Buddhist monastery and a world-renowned center of learning between the 7th century BCE and 1200 CE, Nalanda well deserves to be one of the 7 wonders of India as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Nalanda is located about 95 km from Patna, the capital city of India’s Bihar state. Nalanda is as one of the most famous universities in ancient India that was inspired by the highly organized methods of Vedic learning. The university flourished during the reign of the Gupta Empire and later during the rule of the emperor of Kannauj, Harshavardhana. Nalanda during its peak time was attended by scholars who came from near and far including knowledge-seekers from China, Korea, Central Asia, and Tibet. Sadly, it the University was ransacked and destroyed by a Muslim army of the Mamluk Dynasty in 1200 CE and was eventually abandoned and forgotten. Many years, later, the Government of modern India revived the site, and today it attracts a large number of tourists to the Indian state.
